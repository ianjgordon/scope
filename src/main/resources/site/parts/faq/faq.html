									<h3>About Mindful Monsters</h3>
									<div class="faq" id="1">
										<h4>What is Mindful Monsters?</h4>

										<p>Mindful Monsters is a new, fun way to support the charity Scope. Each month, you donate &pound;7.50 to Scope and, in return, you get seven exciting family activity cards inspired by mindfulness.</p>
										<p>Mindful Monsters gives your kids essential life skills and your donations support parents to give their disabled children the best start in life - it’s a win/win.</p>
										<p>There are 84 cards to collect in total, over 12 months. And once your collection is complete, we hope you will continue to support disabled people and their families through your ongoing donation to Scope.</p>

									<div class="faq" id="2">
										<h4>Why should I use Mindful Monsters?</h4>

										<p>Being a parent puts a lot of pressure on your time, there's no denying that! So, what little quality time you can spend with your kids needs to be special and memorable.</p>
										<p>That's why parents love Mindful Monsters – you'll find activities that can create belly-busting laughter or diffuse tearful tantrums and turn potential meltdown triggers - like getting ready for school or going to bed - into magic moments together.</p>
										<p>And, best of all, each activity takes as little or as long as you like and can fit into the busiest of days.</p>

										<h4>What is mindfulness?</h4>

										<p>It's slowly taking over school, parenting blogs and even your Facebook feed, but what exactly is mindfulness?</p>
										<p>Mindfulness is simply the art of being in the present - paying attention to your thoughts and feelings, moment by moment.</p>
										<p>Many people have found that when we pause and soak up the present, we improve our focus, achieve a sense of calm and have a better overall sense of wellbeing.</p>
										<p>Mindful Monsters activities are inspired by this principle, and help children develop emotional resilience and important life skills.</p>

									</div>

									<div class="faq" id="4">
										<h4>Is there any proof that mindfulness works?</h4>

										<p>Lots! There have been many studies that show that practicing mindfulness creates physical changes in our brains which, to put it simply, make us happier.</p>
										<p>And that’s not all - scientists have seen that these changes last long after the mindfulness activities are over, as long as we are regularly mindful.</p>
										<p>Here's what Michael Chaskalson, a Leading Mindfulness Expert, has to say about mindfulness:</p>
										<blockquote
												cite="Michael Chaskalson, a Leading Mindfulness Expert">"Mindfulness changes lives. Kids who can manage their own emotions do better and an early introduction to mindfulness can really help. When kids learn mindfulness, it sustains their natural curiosity, helping them to engage more deeply with others and with the world around them."

										<h4>What is gift aid?</h4>

										<p>Gift aid is a fantastic governmental scheme, which means that if you are a tax payer, charities may be able to claim an additional 25% of your donation amount from the government.</p>
										<p>To claim gift aid on any eligible donations to Scope, make sure you tick the gift aid box at checkout. It will mean your donations to Scope will go even further to support disabled children and their families.</p>
